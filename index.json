Builds the image remotely and then pulls it down locally. You will need access to SyLabs.io Remote Builder to do this. Getting access to the Remote Builder is beyond the scope of this post. build.sh. Builds the image locally. You will need root privileges to build the container locally.  Building the image locally The script build.sh looks like\n#!/bin/bash IMAGE=singularity-debian-dusty-gcc-v8.3.0.sif DEFINITION=Singularity if [ -f $IMAGE ]; then rm -fv $IMAGE fi sudo singularity build $IMAGE $DEFINITION  To build the image locally simply run\nbash ./build.sh  Building the image remotely The script rbuild.sh looks like\n#!/bin/bash IMAGE=singularity-debian-dusty-gcc-v8.3.0.sif DEFINITION=Singularity if [ -f $IMAGE ]; then rm -fv $IMAGE fi singularity build --remote $IMAGE  If you notice, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much difference between this script and the previous script.\nTo build the image remotely simply run\nbash ./rbuild.sh  Example 1. Building samtools from source THIS EXAMPLE ASSUMES SINGULARITY IS INSTALLED AND IS AVAILABLE TO YOUR USER\nBuilding samtools from source code is a three step process.\nFirst, we need to download the source code for samtools. For version 1.10, type in termninal\nwget -nc https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/download/1.10/samtools-1.10.tar.bz2 bunzip2 samtools-1.10.tar.bz2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -xf samtools-1.10.tar \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -f samtools-1.10.tar  Second, you need to download the image I created from SyLabs (alternatively you can build the image yourself). To download the image type\nsingularity pull --arch amd64 library://icaoberg/default/gcc:v8.3.0  After running these commands, you should see these files/folders\n[gcc-example]$ ls -lt total 149809 -rwxr-xr-x 1 icaoberg icaoberg 153572283 Apr 4 03:39 gcc_v8.3.0.sif drwxrwxr-x 9 icaoberg icaoberg 80 Dec 6 11:46 samtools-1.10  Third, we need to shell into the Singularity image and then compile from source. To shell into the image, type in terminal\nsingularity shell gcc_v8.3.0.sif  Now that we are inside the container, let\u0026rsquo;s change directory to samtools and compile the tool. Type in terminal,\ncd samtools-1.10 ./configure make  After running these commands, you should see the binary now\nSingularity\u0026gt; ls -lt samtools -rwxr-xr-x 1 icaoberg icaoberg 6656944 Apr 4 04:21 samtools  Remember, the you need to run the binary within the container\nSingularity\u0026gt; ./samtools --help Program: samtools (Tools for alignments in the SAM format) Version: 1.10 (using htslib 1.10) Usage: samtools \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; [options] Commands: -- Indexing dict create a sequence dictionary file faidx index/extract FASTA fqidx index/extract FASTQ index index alignment -- Editing calmd recalculate MD/NM tags and '=' bases fixmate fix mate information reheader replace BAM header targetcut cut fosmid regions (for fosmid pool only) addreplacerg adds or replaces RG tags markdup mark duplicates -- File operations collate shuffle and group alignments by name cat concatenate BAMs merge merge sorted alignments mpileup multi-way pileup sort sort alignment file split splits a file by read group quickcheck quickly check if SAM/BAM/CRAM file appears intact fastq converts a BAM to a FASTQ fasta converts a BAM to a FASTA -- Statistics bedcov read depth per BED region coverage alignment depth and percent coverage depth compute the depth flagstat simple stats idxstats BAM index stats phase phase heterozygotes stats generate stats (former bamcheck) -- Viewing flags explain BAM flags tview text alignment viewer view SAM\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;BAM\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;CRAM conversion depad convert padded BAM to unpadded BAM  Example 2.

Just curious if we are reinventing the wheel by doing so and there exists another solution https://t.co/KL0GilswXA\n\u0026mdash; Iván (@justahappygeek) February 26, 2020  Working with environment modules makes my life so much easier.\nFor example, for cowsay,I created a modulefile that will load the Singularity container to the workspace along with a script that calls it. Making the process transparent to the user (very little changes to their scripts, may be their SLURM submission scripts).\nTo make this work you need three things\n an executable script that calls singularity (avoid using alias) the Singularity container file a modulefile  The modulefile file I created for cowsay is the following\n#%Module ## ## cowsay modulefile ## ## modulefiles/ ## set ver 3.03 set msg \u0026quot;This module adds cowsay $ver to various paths\\n\u0026quot; proc ModulesHelp { } { puts stderr $msg } module-whatis \u0026quot;Use cowsay tools $ver\u0026quot; prepend-path PATH /path/to/containers/cowsay/v3.03/  The modulefile itself is very straightforward, all it does is prepend a folder. Now the folder its prepending has two files\n the Singularity image an executable script that calls the image  In my system, there exists a folder with the following files\n[icaoberg] $ ls -lt total 68899 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 70799360 Feb 26 17:48 singularity-debian-buster-cowsay-v3.03.simg -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 366 Feb 26 17:48 cowsay  The contents of cowsay (the script I built, not the actual binary) are\n#!/bin/bash IMAGE=singularity-debian-buster-cowsay-v3.03.simg function is_compute_node(){ if [ -x \u0026quot;$(command -v singularity)\u0026quot; ]; then return 0 else return 1 fi } if is_compute_node; then singularity run --app cowsay $(pwd)/$IMAGE \u0026quot;$1\u0026quot; else echo \u0026quot;Singularity apps cannot run in the head node. Please request an allocation or call Singularity within a job.\u0026quot; fi  Now, the function\nfunction is_compute_node(){ if [ -x \u0026quot;$(command -v singularity)\u0026quot; ]; then return 0 else return 1 fi }  is neccesary because the singularity binary is not accesible from the head node of our HPC cluster. Users must request an allocation to a compute node in order to run apps in Singularity containers.\nExample Say I have the script example.sh\n#!/bin/bash # #$ -j y #$ -S /bin/bash #$ -cwd echo \u0026quot;TOTAL SUCCESS\u0026quot; | cowsay  With the changes above, it will now become\n#!/bin/bash # #$ -j y #$ -S /bin/bash #$ -cwd module load singularity/cowsay-3.03 echo \u0026quot;TOTAL SUCCESS\u0026quot; | cowsay  Submitting the script above using SLURM\nsbatch -p public --mem=1Gb example.sh  should lead to\n _______________ \u0026lt; TOTAL SUCCESS \u0026gt; --------------- \\ ^__^ \\ (oo)\\_______ (__)\\ )\\/\\ ||----w | || ||  Source code I hope you found this post useful.\n GitHub source code repository SyLabs.io Cloud image repository  ","date":1582711200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582711200,"objectID":"a77d1d75946caff27da7e6db1d163f75","permalink":"http://icaoberg.github.io/post/singularity-cowsay/","publishdate":"2020-02-26T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/singularity-cowsay/","section":"post","summary":"Singularity recipe and image for browsh","tags":["singularity","twitter"],"title":"cowsay","type":"post"},{"authors":["icaoberg"],"categories":["Spanish Meetup"],"content":" Filmmaker/Director: Gloria Carrion\nRuntime: 1h 44m\nScreening Date: Tuesday, February 25, 2020\nScreening Location: 203 Frick Fine Arts\nGloria\u0026rsquo;s parents are revolutionary Sandinistas, fighting to liberate Nicaragua from dictatorship.

The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.

Piddy ni siquiera sabe quién es Yaqui, y mucho menos qué es lo que ha hecho para hacerla enfadar. Se dice que Yaqui piensa que Piddy es vanidosa, que se menea al caminar y que no es lo suficiente latina dada su piel blanca, sus buenas calificaciones y su falta de acento. Y Yaqui no bromea, así que mejor que Piddy se cuide su espalda. En un principio, Piddy está más preocupada por saber más sobre su padre al que nunca conoció y cómo equilibrar los cursos de honores y su trabajo de fin de semana en el salón de belleza de su barrio. Pero, a medida que el hostigamiento aumenta, el hecho de evitar a Yaqui y a su grupo empieza a ganar terreno y a ocupar un lugar importante en la vida de Piddy. ¿Existe alguna forma de que Piddy sobreviva sin aislarse o sin escapar?

The goals\n Eat better quality food. Having control of all ingredients that go into my food is essential for keeping my health as optimal as possible. Save money. The excuse that fast food is cheaper is no longer the case. Every day it has become more affordable to cook at home. Even if I were to prepare fast food at home, it would still be more affordable to do so at home.  I have quiches in the past which I enjoy very much. But I want to find a recipe that uses more fresh veggies and less animal protein. Alas, tarte Tatin (or any Franken-tarte thereof).\nOn Pinterest and YouTube I found many alternatives for the dough. But to be honest, that isn\u0026rsquo;t as important to me as the preparation of the vegetables. Today, I made a savory onion tarte Tatin. It was delicious. However I learnt a lot of useful things today\n Cut onions in the opposite direction, pole to pole. If you don\u0026rsquo;t the onions will become mushy by the time these are caramilized. Less sugar is better. I added half of the sugar recommended by most recipes and it was still sweet. Add fresh herbs to caramelized onions once these are fully cooked. Cooking the tarte when the veggies are cold is better.  I enjoyed it but it may have been too sweet for Barbs. I think one of the things I am trying next\n Beet+onion tarte Tatin. I love beets. I could make the traditional caramelized onion version but I think I could add shredded carrots, zucchini and squash. I have to try. If the mixture is too liquid, I think I could add some potato/tapioca starch to make it thicker when cold. This is a little trick I also use when making empanadas.

These are based on what was discussed in the experience today.\nVerbs    Spanish English Comment     aguantar to stand/to put up with/to endure/to hold on You will have to pay attention to context to interpret meaning correctly    These are some examples using the verb aguantar\n Wait, let me hold your bags. / Espera, déjame aguantar tus bolsas. I can\u0026rsquo;t stand you anymore! / ¡Ya no te aguanto más! I can\u0026rsquo;t stand the pain anymore. / No aguanto más el dolor.     Spanish English Comment     cumplido/halago compliment     Now, some of you were asking about this because depending on the electronic resource you were using, it either came up as cumplido o halago.\nAccording to RAE\n cumplido halago  I found some references that state that cumplido, halago and piropo are essentially the same. I disagree. However, colloquially that might be the case.\nTranslation One of the sentences we were trying to translate was the one below\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m dancing in the dark with you between my arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\u0026rdquo; -Ed Sheeran (Perfect)\nNow, think of these two words\n dark. oscuro/oscura. darkness. oscuridad.  Since this is an exercise in translation, I would argue the appropriate translation is\n \u0026ldquo;Estoy bailando a oscuras\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  However, I feel it would be more common to say\n \u0026ldquo;Estoy bailando en la oscuridad\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  Either way, these are proper interpretations. You can find many covers of this song in Spanish on YouTube.\nLyrics Out of the many questions found in the lyrics, please try to answer the following\n What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;el no te cuida\u0026rdquo;? What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;que avisen en el cielo que se les cayó una estrella\u0026rdquo;? What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;verte amanecer\u0026rdquo;?

La mayoría de ellos son prácticamente desconocidos por el público lector del continente, pues han sido extraídos de textos de antropólogos y de selecciones muy poco conocidas. Se trata de una colección única, pues en ella se verá representada la experiencia creativa de autores provenientes de dieciocho países. Los relatos se han organizado en cuatro apartados temáticos: Cuentos de pícaros, bobos y listos (humor), Cuentos de cuando los animales hablaban (didácticos), Cuentos de la maravilla (fantasía) y Cuentos sobre el porqué y el origen de las cosas (mitos). Recomendable para compartir en familia.

I had Kahm yeast grow on top of my ferment. Now let\u0026rsquo;s be clear, this yeast isn\u0026rsquo;t -generally- harmful. However it does indicate there is a problem with the fermentation.\nNow there are some really adventurous people who would remove the yeast and continue to ferment. However the yeast can change the flavor of the ferment and this is my first try at doing this to carrots so I threw them away.\nHowever, there are some things I learnt from this experience\n The carrots were packed tightly without a weight. However the carrots became smaller, hence after 3 to 4 days I needed to add the glass weight.\n The carrots changed color.\n No mold grew on top of the carrots. Meaning the brine was at the right pH. However I didn\u0026rsquo;t measure the pH of the brine since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to consume it.\n The smell of the brine was vinagry but pleasant. Even with the yeast. No bad odors.\n Adding the basil leaves was a total success. After 10 days the carrots were still crispy.\n  So I learnt good things from this experiment.

All these factors have contributed to a dramatic elevation of low frequency noise in the oceanic environment. Research on marine mammals has shown that noise below 500Hz can cause physical trauma to their auditory system. Due to their reliance on their auditory system for survival any drastic increase in noise may compromise their survival. The species in the suborder Mysticeti communicate in frequency ranges from 50-600Hz and thus most affected by increased noise, specifically the six species that are on the endangered species list. We propose that increased oceanic noise will have a deleterious effect on mating and thus reproduction by masking a percentage of mating calls. In order to investigate how noise affects their population dynamics, we modeled the population of Mysticeti whales through a nonlinear system of three discrete time equations (reproductive females, reproductive males, and parental females). Analytical and numerical techniques are used to examine the long-term behavior of our system..","tags":null,"title":"The Demographic Effects of Increasing Anthropogenic Noise on Mysticeti Whales","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" v\u0026mdash;\nDocumentation: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/ title: \u0026ldquo;Daily Report\u0026rdquo; subtitle: \u0026ldquo;TaskWarrior daily progress\u0026rdquo; summary: \u0026ldquo;TaskWarrior daily progress\u0026rdquo; authors: [\u0026ldquo;icaoberg\u0026rdquo;] tags: [] categories: [] date: 2020-02-04 lastmod: 2020-02-04 featured: true draft: false projects: [\u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo;] image: caption: \u0026ldquo;Burndown chart\u0026rdquo; focal_point: \u0026ldquo;Smart\u0026rdquo;\npreview_only: true THIS IS AUTOMATED REPORT  Daily Burndown () 2000 | | | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
