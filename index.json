Piddy ni siquiera sabe quién es Yaqui, y mucho menos qué es lo que ha hecho para hacerla enfadar. Se dice que Yaqui piensa que Piddy es vanidosa, que se menea al caminar y que no es lo suficiente latina dada su piel blanca, sus buenas calificaciones y su falta de acento. Y Yaqui no bromea, así que mejor que Piddy se cuide su espalda. En un principio, Piddy está más preocupada por saber más sobre su padre al que nunca conoció y cómo equilibrar los cursos de honores y su trabajo de fin de semana en el salón de belleza de su barrio. Pero, a medida que el hostigamiento aumenta, el hecho de evitar a Yaqui y a su grupo empieza a ganar terreno y a ocupar un lugar importante en la vida de Piddy. ¿Existe alguna forma de que Piddy sobreviva sin aislarse o sin escapar?

The goals\n Eat better quality food. Having control of all ingredients that go into my food is essential for keeping my health as optimal as possible. Save money. The excuse that fast food is cheaper is no longer the case. Every day it has become more affordable to cook at home. Even if I were to prepare fast food at home, it would still be more affordable to do so at home.  I have quiches in the past which I enjoy very much. But I want to find a recipe that uses more fresh veggies and less animal protein. Alas, tarte Tatin (or any Franken-tarte thereof).\nOn Pinterest and YouTube I found many alternatives for the dough. But to be honest, that isn\u0026rsquo;t as important to me as the preparation of the vegetables. Today, I made a savory onion tarte Tatin. It was delicious. However I learnt a lot of useful things today\n Cut onions in the opposite direction, pole to pole. If you don\u0026rsquo;t the onions will become mushy by the time these are caramilized. Less sugar is better. I added half of the sugar recommended by most recipes and it was still sweet. Add fresh herbs to caramelized onions once these are fully cooked. Cooking the tarte when the veggies are cold is better.  I enjoyed it but it may have been too sweet for Barbs. I think one of the things I am trying next\n Beet+onion tarte Tatin. I love beets. I could make the traditional caramelized onion version but I think I could add shredded carrots, zucchini and squash. I have to try. If the mixture is too liquid, I think I could add some potato/tapioca starch to make it thicker when cold. This is a little trick I also use when making empanadas.

These are based on what was discussed in the experience today.\nVerbs    Spanish English Comment     aguantar to stand/to put up with/to endure/to hold on You will have to pay attention to context to interpret meaning correctly    These are some examples using the verb aguantar\n Wait, let me hold your bags. / Espera, déjame aguantar tus bolsas. I can\u0026rsquo;t stand you anymore! / ¡Ya no te aguanto más! I can\u0026rsquo;t stand the pain anymore. / No aguanto más el dolor.     Spanish English Comment     cumplido/halago compliment     Now, some of you were asking about this because depending on the electronic resource you were using, it either came up as cumplido o halago.\nAccording to RAE\n cumplido halago  I found some references that state that cumplido, halago and piropo are essentially the same. I disagree. However, colloquially that might be the case.\nTranslation One of the sentences we were trying to translate was the one below\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m dancing in the dark with you between my arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\u0026rdquo; -Ed Sheeran (Perfect)\nNow, think of these two words\n dark. oscuro/oscura. darkness. oscuridad.  Since this is an exercise in translation, I would argue the appropriate translation is\n \u0026ldquo;Estoy bailando a oscuras\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  However, I feel it would be more common to say\n \u0026ldquo;Estoy bailando en la oscuridad\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  Either way, these are proper interpretations. You can find many covers of this song in Spanish on YouTube.\nLyrics Out of the many questions found in the lyrics, please try to answer the following\n What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;el no te cuida\u0026rdquo;? What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;que avisen en el cielo que se les cayó una estrella\u0026rdquo;? What does he mean by \u0026ldquo;verte amanecer\u0026rdquo;?

La mayoría de ellos son prácticamente desconocidos por el público lector del continente, pues han sido extraídos de textos de antropólogos y de selecciones muy poco conocidas. Se trata de una colección única, pues en ella se verá representada la experiencia creativa de autores provenientes de dieciocho países. Los relatos se han organizado en cuatro apartados temáticos: Cuentos de pícaros, bobos y listos (humor), Cuentos de cuando los animales hablaban (didácticos), Cuentos de la maravilla (fantasía) y Cuentos sobre el porqué y el origen de las cosas (mitos).

I had Kahm yeast grow on top of my ferment. Now let\u0026rsquo;s be clear, this yeast isn\u0026rsquo;t -generally- harmful. However it does indicate there is a problem with the fermentation.\nNow there are some really adventurous people who would remove the yeast and continue to ferment. However the yeast can change the flavor of the ferment and this is my first try at doing this to carrots so I threw them away.\nHowever, there are some things I learnt from this experience\n The carrots were packed tightly without a weight. However the carrots became smaller, hence after 3 to 4 days I needed to add the glass weight.\n The carrots changed color.\n No mold grew on top of the carrots. Meaning the brine was at the right pH. However I didn\u0026rsquo;t measure the pH of the brine since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to consume it.\n The smell of the brine was vinagry but pleasant. Even with the yeast. No bad odors.\n Adding the basil leaves was a total success. After 10 days the carrots were still crispy.\n  So I learnt good things from this experiment.
